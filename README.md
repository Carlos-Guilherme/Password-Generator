# Password-Generator

This is a Python program that generates random passwords and displays them in a GUI created using the CustomTkinter library. The user can select the types of characters they want to include in the password, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. In addition, the user can also define the length of the password to be generated. When the "Generate" button is clicked, the password is generated and displayed in a text field on the interface. The user can then copy the password to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button. The program uses random, string and pyperclip libraries to generate random passwords, manipulate strings and copy text to the clipboard.
